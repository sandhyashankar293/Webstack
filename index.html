            <h2>Client/Server Model</h2>
            <p>The Client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters called clients. In the client-server architecture, when the client computer sends a request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and delivers the data packets requested back to the client. Clients do not share any of their resources. Examples of the Client-Server Model are Email, World Wide Web, etc.</p>
<p>How Does the Client-Server Model Work?
In this article, we are going to take a dive into the Client-Server model and have a look at how the Internet works via, web browsers. This article will help us have a solid WEB foundation and help us easily work with WEB technologies.</p>
<p>Client: When we say the word Client, it means to talk of a person or an organization using a particular service. Similarly in the digital world, a Client is a computer (Host) i.e. capable of receiving information or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers).
Servers: Similarly, when we talk about the word Servers, It means a person or medium that serves something. Similarly in this digital world, a Server is a remote computer that provides information (data) or access to particular services.
So, it is the Client requesting something and the Server serving it as long as it is in the database.</p>

            <h2>Web Search Engine</h2>
            <p>A Web search engine is a specialized computer server that searches for information on the Web. The search results of a user query are often returned as a list (sometimes called hits). The hits may consist of web pages, images, and other types of files. Some search engines also search and return data available in public databases or open directories. Search engines differ from web directories in that web directories are maintained by human editors whereas search engines operate algorithmically or by a mixture of algorithmic and human input.</p>

            <h3>Web Crawling</h3>
            <p>Web Crawler is a bot that downloads the content from the internet and indexes it. The main purpose of this bot is to learn about the different web pages on the internet. This kind of bots is mostly operated by search engines. By applying the search algorithms to the data collected by the web crawlers, search engines can provide the relevant links as a response for the request requested by the user. In this article, let’s discuss how the web crawler is implemented. </p>
            <h3>Web Indexing</h3>
            <p>Web indexing is the process of collecting and storing information from web pages to create a searchable index that can be used by search engines to provide relevant results to users' queries.


Web indexing is a crucial aspect of website creation and specifically website development because it helps to:


Improve search engine optimization (SEO) by making it easier for search engines to find and index web pages.
Increase website traffic by making it easier for users to find relevant content on a website.
Enhance user experience on a site by providing easy navigation and access to content.</p>
            <h3>Search Engine Optimization and Limitations</h3>
            <p>SEO (search engine optimization) is the practice of optimizing the performance of a website by changing its structure and content to increase its visibility and web traffic. It helps in improving the quality of your website and increases the viewer-to-customer conversion rate.
It is a crucial aspect of digital marketing that focuses on enhancing the visibility and ranking of a website in search engine results pages (SERPs). The primary goal of SEO is to drive organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by improving its relevance and authority in the eyes of search engines. This SEO Tutorial covers a2z SEO concepts.</p>

            <h2>Web Services</h2>
            <p>The Internet is the worldwide connectivity of hundreds of thousands of computers of various types that belong to multiple networks. On the World Wide Web, a web service is a standardized method for propagating messages between client and server applications. A web service is a software module that is intended to carry out a specific set of functions. Web services in cloud computing can be found and invoked over the network.
The web service would be able to deliver functionality to the client that invoked the web service.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to CSS3</h2>
            <p>CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets, is a game-changing language that revolutionized the web design process. With its simple design, CSS makes it easy to enhance the presentation of web pages, by applying styles independently of the HTML that makes up each page. Essentially, CSS is responsible for the aesthetic appeal of a website, dictating everything from font choice to color scheme and spacing. With this language, developers and designers can create visually appealing websites that truly stand out.</p>
            <section id="css2-vs-css3">
    <h3>CSS2 vs CSS3</h3>
    <p><strong>CSS:</strong> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is primarily used to provide styling to web pages, including color, layout, background, font, and border properties. The main objective of CSS is to improve content accessibility, provide enhanced flexibility and control, and specify presentation characteristics.</p>
    
    <p><strong>CSS3:</strong> CSS3 stands for Cascading Style Sheets Level 3. It is an advanced version of CSS, used for structuring, styling, and formatting web pages. CSS3 introduces several new features and is supported by all modern web browsers. One of the most significant advancements in CSS3 is the splitting of CSS standards into separate modules, making it simpler to learn and use.</p>
